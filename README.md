# React Portfolio 
This project is a modern, single-page portfolio website built with React. It is designed to be clean, professional, and fully responsive, showcasing personal information, skills, and projects in a structured way. ## Features  
**Component-Based Architecture:** The application is broken down into reusable React components for easy maintenance and scalability. 
**Responsive Design:** The layout adapts smoothly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
**Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links provide a smooth scrolling experience between sections.
**Animated Sections:** Sections animate into view as the user scrolls down the page, creating a dynamic user experience.
**Centralized Styling:** All styles are managed in a single `index.css` file, making it easy to customize the look and feel of the entire application.  

## Tech Stack  - 
**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
**Vite:** A modern frontend build tool that provides a fast development experience. 
**JavaScript (ES6+):** The core programming language. - **CSS3:** Used for all styling and layout, including variables for easy theme changes.
**HTML5:** The markup language for the base page. 

### File Descriptions

- **`src/main.jsx`**: This is the main entry point. It finds the `<div id="root"></div>` in `public/index.html` and injects the main `<App />` component into it.
- **`src/App.jsx`**: The top-level component. It imports and arranges all the major sections of the portfolio (`Header`, `HeroSection`, `Footer`, etc.).
- **`src/index.css`**: Contains all the CSS styles for the entire application. You can change colors, fonts, and layouts here.
- **`src/components/`**: This directory holds all the reusable React components. Each component is responsible for a specific piece of the UI (e.g., `Header.js` handles the navigation bar).
- **`public/index.html`**: The single HTML page of the application. The React app is loaded into the `root` div of this file.

To personalize this portfolio, you can edit the following files:

- **Text Content:** To change the text in the "Hero," "About," or "Contact" sections, edit the corresponding component files in `src/components/`. For example, to change the "About Me" text, edit `src/components/AboutSection.js`.
- **Projects:** To add, remove, or edit projects, modify the `projects` array inside the `src/components/ProjectsSection.js` file.
- **Styling:** To change colors, fonts, or spacing, edit the CSS variables at the top of the `src/index.css` file.
- **Social Links:** To update the social media links in the footer, edit the `socialLinks` array inside `src/components/Footer.js`.
